## 🔐 About the Code

This repo is part of my personal portfolio and is **closed-source by design**.  
However, if you're interested in working together or seeing code examples, I’m happy to:
- Share code snippets privately
- Walk through architecture in a call
- Demo how the Render + GitHub flow works
