# 🧠 Criminal Minds Simulator

An AI-driven simulation game inspired by real-world criminal profiling, interrogation tactics, and behavioral analysis.

This project is part of my private portfolio and is being showcased **without source code**.

## 🧩 Overview

> "Step into the shoes of a profiler. Identify patterns. Interrogate suspects. Predict criminal behaviour before the next move is made."

Criminal Minds Sim is a logic-based decision simulator that blends AI, psychology, and user choices to build case files and hunt suspects.  
Built for web, it features dynamic text feedback, branching outcomes, and simulated "mental state" scoring.
