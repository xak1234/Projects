# 💼 Grant Wilson – Web Dev Project Showcase

Welcome to my personal project portfolio.  
This repo showcases a curated collection of my closed-source web apps and games — fully designed, developed, and deployed by me.

Each folder contains a live project overview, screenshots, and feature breakdowns.  
**Code is private**, but demos, walkthroughs, and collabs are always open.

## 🔐 Why No Code?

These projects are private by design to protect original game logic, mechanics, and engine structures.  
If you're a recruiter or collaborator, I'm happy to:

- Provide video walkthroughs
- Share snippets privately
- Do a live technical review
