## 🗺️ About the Game

> "Make it through checkpoints, dodge detention, and maybe — just maybe — get asylum. Or don't."

Migrantopoly is a fully playable web-based board game built to highlight real-world issues through gameplay.  
Players navigate a fictionalized but grounded version of migration routes, facing random events, risk rolls, legal aid, and system collapse.

It’s Monopoly meets moral choices meets societal commentary.
