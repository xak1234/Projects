## 🧠 Concept

> "You were taken. You were studied. They dropped you back to watch what happens next."

Abductor is a fast-paced, minimalist survival game where each session throws you into a procedurally generated map filled with danger.  
Your only goal? Find the portal before the countdown ends and the UFO returns.
